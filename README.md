# Building Space Station in AR
A fun interactive game to build a cool space station on Mars in AR. Point the camera to a groundplane or a marker and start building!
You can place your greenhouses, spaceship and planets all around the space, and then hit "Play" to see them come alive traveling around your space. There are also some mini games and function for you to play with such as collecting dropped cargos to the greenhouses.

### Build mode
- Create and placing object:
  - To create an object, select one of three icons (spaceship, planet, greenhouse) of the upper-left panel. A sample will appear in the middle of the ground plane. 
  - User then use the controllers at the right hand side to control: 
    - Spaceship: 
      - Control Position + Rotation + Height
    - Planet:
      - Control Position + Rotation + Height
    - Greenhouse:
      - Control Position + Rotation
- User then presses “Place!” to position the object in place (no more controls). Or presses “Cancel!” to omit that object.



### Play mode
- Animations:
  When switching to Play mode, users will see:
    - Spaceship moving back and forth, at the same time dropping cargo periodically. 
    - Planet turns around its own center and around the center of the detected plane.
- Interactions:
    - Users can drag the dropped cargos around the plane.
    - When the cargos are dragged to the greenhouse, they will be retrieved and notified with a popup yellow text.
